# Donate
#### Reducing food waste by creating an efficient system for restaurants to donate leftover food to charities

This is an app built with React Native and an extension of [don8](https://github.com/Jayreg3/don8).

Getting Started
===============
**Step 1**
```
npm install
npm start
```
This should run a server that can be opened in a browser.

**Step 2**
Install Expo Client (iOS and Android) to run the app on your device.
Or use the CLI to run it in your browser.
**Note:** Use native camera on iOS and your iPhone should give an option to open in Expo Client.

**Step 3**
Make any changes to App.js and see changes reflect live (usually 2-3 second lag after first run).
