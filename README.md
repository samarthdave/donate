# Donate
#### Reducing food waste by creating an efficient system for restaurants to donate leftover food to charities

This is an app built with React Native and an extension of [don8](https://github.com/Jayreg3/don8).

Getting Started
===============
**Step 1**
After cloning this repository, navigate into it and then:
```
npm install
npm start
```
This should run a server that can be opened in a browser.

**Step 2**
Install Expo Client (iOS and Android) to run the app on your device.
Or use the CLI to run it in your browser.
**Note:** Use native camera on iOS and your iPhone should give an option to open in Expo Client.

**Step 3**
Create an account with Expo on your device and then in your terminal:
```
expo login
```
Login with your credentials, then:
```
npm start
```
You should now be able to run the app on your phone.

**Step 4**
Make any changes to App.js and see changes reflect live (usually 2-3 second lag after first run).

**Optional Step**
You can install a simulator for Android and iOS on your computer by following the instructions in the "Get started with Expo" tab in the app on your phone.
